# Jira Agile Test

This project was completed as part of a [Udemy course: The Complete 2024 Software Testing Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/testerbootcamp/?couponCode=ST12MT030524).

The purpose of this project was to introduce agile testing using Jira, including:
* writing user epics and stories
* writing test cases
* writing acceptance criteria
* adding components, environments, priority and story points
* adding issues to sprints and adding bug reports to a stabilisation sprint

Test cases were written for Uber.
